## 🥇 Step 1: **Start with the Problem Statement (2 lines max)**

_"In this practical, we apply Neural Style Transfer to combine the **content of one image** with the **style of another image**,  
using a pre-trained deep learning model, **VGG19**."_

**(Corporate tone: Problem → Solution immediately.)**

---

## 🥈 Step 2: **High-level Approach**

> "_We extract high-level features from both the content and style images using VGG19.  
We define two types of losses — Content Loss and Style Loss — and optimize a generated image to minimize both losses._"

---
  
## 🥉 Step 3: **Step-by-Step Breakdown (Logical & Fast)**

### a) **Load Images**
- Load content and style images.
- Resize them to 400x400 for manageable computation.

### b) **Preprocessing (Important Point)**

> "_Since VGG19 was trained on ImageNet with OpenCV,  
we **convert RGB to BGR** and **subtract mean pixel values** channel-wise  
to match the training data distribution._"

(✅ Use the theory you just learned.)

---

### c) **Load Pre-trained VGG19 Model**
- **No training** — only **feature extraction**.
- Take intermediate outputs from:
  - Content layer: **block4_conv2**
  - Style layers: **block1_conv1**, **block2_conv1**, etc.

---

### d) **Feature Extraction**
- Run content and style images through VGG19.
- Save the feature representations.

---

### e) **Define Loss Functions**
- **Content Loss:** Measures difference between content features.
- **Style Loss:** Measures difference between Gram Matrices (captures texture and style).

_(Explain Gram Matrix as: "captures spatial relationships between features" — that's enough.)_

---

### f) **Optimization**
- Start with the content image as the base.
- **Iteratively update** the image using **Adam Optimizer** to minimize total loss.
- Loss = Content Loss + (small weight × Style Loss)

---
  
## 🏆 Step 4: **Result**
> "_After 42 iterations, the generated image successfully blends the original content with the desired style._"

✅ If possible, open the output image for the examiner and say:  
_"This is the final stylized output."_
