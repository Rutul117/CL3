### **Introduction**

Start with an overview of the task:

**"The task at hand was to simulate the functioning of load balancing algorithms to distribute client requests across multiple servers. The algorithms we focus on are Round Robin (RR), Least Connections (LC), and Weighted Round Robin (WRR). We implemented these algorithms in a Python program that simulates client requests and server load distribution."**

### **Key Components of the Program**

**1. Server Class**
- **Purpose**: "The `Server` class represents the servers that will handle the client requests."
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: "A unique identifier for each server."
  - `weight`: "This is used for the Weighted Round Robin algorithm to represent the server's processing capability."
  - `active_connections`: "Tracks the number of requests the server is currently handling."
  - `busy_time`: "The total time the server has been actively processing requests."
- **Methods**: `__str__`: "Provides a string representation of the server, which includes its ID, active connections, and weight."

**2. Request Class**
- **Purpose**: "The `Request` class models a client request."
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: "A unique identifier for each client request."
  - `processing_time`: "A randomly generated value representing how long the request will take to process (between 1 and 5 seconds)."

**3. LoadBalancer Class**
- **Purpose**: "The `LoadBalancer` class manages the requests and distributes them across servers using different load balancing algorithms."
- **Attributes**:
  - `servers`: "A list of server objects available to handle requests."
  - `rr_index` and `weight_index`: "These keep track of the current index in the Round Robin and Weighted Round Robin algorithms respectively."
  - `total_requests`, `total_waiting_time`, `total_simulation_time`: "These track metrics like the total number of requests processed, the total waiting time, and the total simulation time."
  
- **Methods for Load Balancing Algorithms**:
  - **Round Robin (`assign_round_robin`)**: 
    - "This method assigns each request to a server in a cyclic manner. The `rr_index` keeps track of which server is next, and after each assignment, the index is incremented in a round-robin fashion."
  
  - **Least Connections (`assign_least_connections`)**:
    - "This method selects the server with the least number of active connections to handle the next request."
  
  - **Weighted Round Robin (`assign_weighted_rr`)**:
    - "This method adjusts the round-robin approach by considering server weights. Servers with higher weights get more requests. This is achieved by creating a list of servers that includes each server multiple times according to its weight."

  - **`process` Method**:
    - "This method simulates the processing of a request by a server. It tracks the request’s processing time, updates the server’s connection count, and calculates various metrics like the total waiting time and server busy time."

  - **`calculate_utilization`**:
    - "This method calculates the server utilization by comparing the total busy time of each server against the total simulation time, giving a percentage utilization for each server."

### **Simulation Process**
- **Simulation Setup**:
  - "We simulate the arrival of 10 client requests. For each request, we generate a random processing time."
  - "Then, depending on the algorithm selected (`rr`, `lc`, or `wrr`), the `LoadBalancer` assigns the request to one of the servers using the chosen algorithm."
  
- **Metrics Calculation**:
  - "After processing all requests, we calculate:
    - **Average Waiting Time**: "This is the average time all requests have spent waiting for processing."
    - **Server Utilization**: "This measures how much time each server was actively processing requests compared to the total simulation time."

- **Output**:
  - "The program outputs key performance metrics, such as the total number of requests processed, the average waiting time, and server utilization."

### **Running the Simulations**
- **Explanation of the Execution**:
  - "At the end, we run the simulation for each of the three algorithms: Round Robin, Least Connections, and Weighted Round Robin. This gives us an insight into how each algorithm performs under the same simulated conditions."

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Summary of the Results**:
  - "Through this program, we are able to simulate and compare the behavior of three different load balancing algorithms."
  - "Each algorithm handles client requests differently, which reflects how the system can be optimized based on the characteristics of the incoming requests and the servers available."

- **Application**:
  - "In real-world scenarios, load balancing is crucial for efficient resource utilization, reducing latency, and ensuring high availability in distributed systems."
